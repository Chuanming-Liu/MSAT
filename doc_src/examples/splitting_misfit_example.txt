Example 6: Splitting misfit measurement and model fitting
=========================================================

In this example we show the results of various methods that can be used 
to determine the misfit between different shear wave splitting (SWS) 
parameters and illustrate how these can be used to fit a model
to measured SWS data. The four methods that are implemented in MSAT 
which can be used to estimate the difference between one 
splitting parameter, latexmath:[$\Gamma_1 = (dt_1 , \phi_1)$], and 
a second, latexmath:[$\Gamma_2 = (dt_2 , \phi_2)$], are first outlined
and results illustrated. In the second part of the example we show 
how this approach can be used to find the best-fitting model assuming 
tilted transverse isotropy (TTI) to a collection of synthetic SWS 
measurements. 

The example file demo_splitting_misfit in the examples/splitting_misfit
directory shows how the MSAT function MS_splitting_misfit can be used 
and plots the value of the misfit function for pairs of splitting 
parameters. The reference splitting parameters, latexmath:[$\Gamma_1$],
for this illustration are latexmath:[$dt_1 = 2$] seconds and 
latexmath:[$\phi_1 = 0$] degrees. This is compared with 
latexmath:[$\Gamma_2$] with values varying from
latexmath:[$\phi_2 = -90$] to latexmath:[$\phi_2 = 90$] degrees and 
latexmath:[$dt_2 = 0$] to latexmath:[$dt_2 = 4$] seconds. For the methods
that are sensitive to source polarization three values are used, 45, 
30 and 0 degrees. The calculation of misfit over this grid of values 
of latexmath:[$\Gamma_2$] is done as follows in the function 
calc_misfit_surface:
[code, python]
----
   fast = [-90:5:90] ;
   tlag = [0:0.1:4] ;

   [TLAG,FAST] = meshgrid(tlag,fast) ;
   MISFIT = FAST.*0 ;

   % generate misfit 
   for itlag=1:length(tlag)
      for ifast=1:length(fast)
        MISFIT(ifast,itlag) = ...
           MS_splitting_misfit(fast_ref,tlag_ref, ...
              fast(ifast),tlag(itlag),spol,0.1,'mode',modeStr,'max_tlag',10) ;
      end
   end

----
The call to MS_splitting_misfit calculates the misfit for each of the 
values of latexmath:[$\Gamma_2$]. This is done for each of the 
polarisation directions and misfit calculation methods ("simple", 
"intensity", "lam2" and "lam2S") and the calculated misfit 
surfaces plotted.
