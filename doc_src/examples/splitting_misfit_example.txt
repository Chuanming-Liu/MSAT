Example 6: Splitting misfit measurement and model fitting
=========================================================

In this example we show the results of various methods that can be used 
to determine the misfit between different shear wave splitting (SWS) 
parameters and illustrate how these can be used to fit a model
to measured SWS data. The four methods that are implemented in MSAT 
which can be used to estimate the difference between one 
splitting parameter, latexmath:[$\Gamma_1 = (dt_1 , \phi_1)$], and 
a second, latexmath:[$\Gamma_2 = (dt_2 , \phi_2)$], are first outlined
and results illustrated. In the second part of the example we show 
how this approach can be used to find the best-fitting model assuming 
tilted transverse isotropy (TTI) to a collection of synthetic SWS 
measurements. 

Calculating a misfit
--------------------

The example file demo_splitting_misfit in the examples/splitting_misfit
directory shows how the MSAT function MS_splitting_misfit can be used 
and plots the value of the misfit function for pairs of splitting 
parameters. The reference splitting parameters, latexmath:[$\Gamma_1$],
for this illustration are latexmath:[$dt_1 = 2$] seconds and 
latexmath:[$\phi_1 = 0$] degrees. This is compared with 
latexmath:[$\Gamma_2$] with values varying from
latexmath:[$\phi_2 = -90$] to latexmath:[$\phi_2 = 90$] degrees and 
latexmath:[$dt_2 = 0$] to latexmath:[$dt_2 = 4$] seconds. For the methods
that are sensitive to source polarization three values are used, 45, 
30 and 0 degrees. The calculation of misfit over this grid of values 
of latexmath:[$\Gamma_2$] is done as follows in the function 
calc_misfit_surface:
[code, python]
----
   fast = [-90:5:90] ;
   tlag = [0:0.1:4] ;

   [TLAG,FAST] = meshgrid(tlag,fast) ;
   MISFIT = FAST.*0 ;

   % generate misfit 
   for itlag=1:length(tlag)
      for ifast=1:length(fast)
        MISFIT(ifast,itlag) = ...
           MS_splitting_misfit(fast_ref,tlag_ref, ...
              fast(ifast),tlag(itlag),spol,0.1,'mode',modeStr,'max_tlag',10) ;
      end
   end

----
The call to MS_splitting_misfit calculates the misfit for each of the 
values of latexmath:[$\Gamma_2$]. This is done for each of the 
polarisation directions and misfit calculation methods ("simple", 
"intensity", "lam2" and "lam2S") and the calculated misfit 
surfaces plotted.  

The images below show the misfit surfaces produced by the 
demo_splitting_misfit example for the 0 degree polarisation angle. 
It is instructive to first considerate "simple" approach (lower XXX
figure).  WHAT IT DOES - reference - WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE - CHANGING 
WAITING. Another approach is the comparison of splitting intensity 
activated by the "intensity" method. This is described by XXX and 
WORKS LIKE THIS. SHOWN IN XXX. MSAT also implements two other
approaches motivated by the way that SWS parameters are 
extracted and, in particular the XXX method of (REFERENCES). 
Details of the approach, which involves splitting a 
probe wavelet using latexmath:[$\Gamma_1$],  
"unsplitting" it using latexmath:[$\Gamma_2$], and comparing the 
result with the probe wavelet, is given in the user guide 
LINK but the results are shown in the XXX and YYY figures. In the 
following section the "XXX" misfit function is used to
