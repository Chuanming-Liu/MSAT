Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit - using the functions
=======================================================

This section of the user guide includes some information on the functions provided in the MSAT toolkit.
The functions provided by MSAT can be classified into groups according to how they are used. These groups 
broadly correspond to how elasticity matricies appear in the input and output arguments lists. In all 
cases function names begin with "MS_" and where elastic constants (stiffness) tensors are used they 
are represented using Voigt notation as a 6x6 Matlab array. Argument lists typically begin with the 
elasticity matrix followed, where needed, by the density. Units are always GPa for the elasticity,
km/s for phase velocities and kg/m^3 for densities.

The input and generation functions
----------------------------------

The first group of functions generate elasticity matrices from input 
arguments (see the table below). MS_load and MS_load_list
read data from input files 
while MS_elasticDB extracts elasticity information from a
builtin database. Other functions create elasticity matrices 
from summary information and a knowledge of the symmetry. 

It is also possible to model the effective anisotropic elasticity caused by particular
rock fabrics; an effect that can be important even if all the components of the rock are isotropic
on a short length scale compared to the seismic wavelength. Several effecive medium models are 
supported by the MS_effective_medum function. These include the case of an
elastically isotropic medium contains aligned ellipsoidal 
inclusions filled with an elastically isotropic material of a different stiffnes,
the case of layering of isotropic materials of different stiffness, and the effect of 
alligned cracks.

The manipulation functions 
--------------------------

A second group of functions include elasticity matrices as input and output. These
functions, listed below, are used to manipulate or
transform an elasticity matrix. MS_rot3,
MS_rotEuler and MS_rotR all rotate an elasticity matrix (the 
functions differ in the way the rotation is specified). MS_axes also rotates an 
input matrix but by an amount designed to allow the anisotropic nature of the 
matrix to be analysed. Such analysis makes use of two other functions,
MS_decomp and MS_norms. Taken together, these three
functions allow the symmetry of elasticity matrices to be expressed following 
the approach of Browaeys and Chevrot (2004). An example of this approach is given 
below. MS_VRH calculates the Voigt, Reuss, and 
Voigt-Reuss-Hill average elasticity of an aggregate of materials, 
each described by their own elasticity matrix and volume fraction, while 
MS_polyaverage takes this averaging one step further and estimates the 
isotopic elasticity matrix if the components are randomly oriented.

The analysis functions 
----------------------

The third group of functions allow elasticity to be analysed or displayed.
They take elasticity matrices as input arguments and either return derived 
quantities or cause graphics to be produced. Examples include MS_anisotropy,
which implements some of the attempts to capture the degree of elastic anisotropy
of a material as a single value and 
MS_poisson which calculates
Poisson's ratio for a general anisotropic material as a function of direction.
MS_phasevels solves the Christoffel
equation for given propagation directions and returns the three seismic phase velocities 
along with their polarisations. This function is used by MS_plot and MS_sphere,
which plot the resulting seismic anisotropy on a pole figures and a three-dimensional
spherical representation, respectively.
