== MS_plot

 MS_PLOT - Plot phasevels/anisotropy on pole figures.

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 Given an elasticity matrix and density, produce pole figures showing 
     the P- and S-wave anisotrpy. 

 MS_plot(C, rh, ...)

 Usage: 
     MS_plot(C, rh)                    
         Produce three pole figures showing P-wave velocity, S-wave
         anisotropy and fast S-wave polarisation direction

     MS_plot(C, rh, ...)                    
          Further arguments are EVALed (most useful to change various 
          options, see source-code for details).
