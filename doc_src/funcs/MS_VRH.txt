== MS_VRH

  [Cave,rhave]=CIJ_VRH(VF,C1,rho1,C2,rho2,...)

  n phase Voigt-Reuss-Hill average of elastic tensors (C1, C2 etc) and
  densities (rho1, rho2 etc). VF is a vector of volume fractions. There should
  be a C,rho argument pair for each entry in this vector. The sum of the 
  elements of VF is normalised to 1 before averaging.
