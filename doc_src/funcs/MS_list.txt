== MS_list

 MS_LIST - Print elasticity matrix (in 'list' format)

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 CIJ_list(C,rho)

 Usage: 
     CIJ_list(C,rho)
         For a given 6x6 elasticity matrix, C, and density, rho, print 
         the constants.

  Notes: 
    The 'list' format consists of three numbers per line. The first two 
    are integers representing the location in the elasticity matrix in
    Voigt notation, the third is the value of the elastic constant. After
    the 36 lines of elastic constants a line containing the density is
    printed with dummy indices '7 7'. This function exists to allow 
    MSAT to be interfaced with legacy code.
