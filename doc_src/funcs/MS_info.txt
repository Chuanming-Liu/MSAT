== MS_info

 MS_INFO - Information about an elasticity matrix.

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 Prints out or returns a variety of information about an input elasticity
 matrix.

 [ ... ] = MS_info( C, ... )

 Usage: 
     [] = MS_info(C)                    
         Prints to the screen the default information about the matrix. 

     [] = MS_info(C, rho)                    
         If the density is provided, velocity information is returned. 

     [] = MS_info(C, rho, 'mode', MODE)
         Choose the set of outputs to return. Currently supported are:
           'all' : all available information (default)
           'vel' : just report velocity information
           'rot' : just report rotational information

     [] = MS_info(C, 'mode', MODE)
         As above, be default to 'rot'.

     [report] = MS_info(C, ...)                    
         As above, but return information in a string. Don't print to 
         screen.
