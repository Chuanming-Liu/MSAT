== MS_load

 MS_LOAD - Load a set of elastic constants from a file.

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //
 
 [ ... ] = MS_load( fname, ... )

 Usage: 
     [C] = MS_load(fname)                    
         Load the elastic constants in file 'fname'. See file format below. 

     [C,r] = MS_load(fname,...)                    
         Load the elastic constants and density in file 'fname'. See file 
         format below.

     [C,...] = MS_load(fname,...,'format',fmt)                    
         Specify format for file. See below for descriptions. Available options 
         are:
            'simple' : Formatted text file (default)

     [C,...] = MS_load(fname,...,'symmetry', mode) 
         ** some parts not yet implemented **
         Fill out elastic tensor based on symmetry, defined by mode. This can
         take the following values:
            'none' - nothing attempted, unspecified Cijs are zero (default)
            'auto' - assume symmetry based on number of Cijs specified 
            'iso' - isotropic (nCij=2) ; C33 and C66 must be specified.
            'hex' - hexagonal (nCij=5) ; C11, C33, C44, C66 and C13 must be
                       specified, x3 is symmetry axis
            'vti' - synonym for hexagonal
            'cubic' - cubic (nCij=3) ; C33, C66 and C12 must be specified

     [C,...] = MS_load(fname,...,'eunit',unit)
         Specify elasticity unit; this is used to convert to GPa (msat's 
         default operating unit)
            'GPa' - elastic constants are already in GPa (default)
            'Mbar' - elastic constants are in Mbar
            'Pa' - elastic constants are in Pascals
            'bar' - elastic constants are in bar

     [C,...] = MS_load(fname,...,'dunit',unit)
         Specify density unit; this is used to convert to kg/m3 (msat's 
         default operating unit)
            'kgm3' - density is already in kg/m3 (default)
            'gcc' - density is in g/cc

     [C,...] = MS_load(fname,...,'Aij')
         Elasticities are specified in density normalised form. This option
         requires a density to be specified, the elasticities are returned with
         the normalisation reversed (default format for msat). The density
         normalisation is assumed to have been performed using the density 
         specified in the file (so, obviously, one is required) without any
         different unit scalings. It is *highly* advisable to check (for 
         example using MS_phasevels) that sensible numbers result. The default
         is to assume that the input is not density normalised. 

     [C,...] = MS_load(fname,...,'force')
         Disable post-load checking. You're on your own, buddy.

  Supported file formats:
  -----------------------

  * 'simple' (default)
        
     In this mode MS_load expects an ascii file containing lines of the form:

     I J C(I,J)

     Elasticity tensor components are specified by their indices (i,j). Any 
     number other than 1-6 in the i or j column denotes that a density is 
     being given. 

     So, for olivine, the file might look like:
     
     
     1 1 320.5
     1 2 68.1
     1 3 71.6
     ...
     6 6 78.7
     0 0 3325
     
     Text following a '' in any line is ignored (useful for header lines or 
     comments)

  * 'ematrix'

    Elastic constants in the format read by EMATRIX (D. Mainprice).
