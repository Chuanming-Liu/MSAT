== MS_rot3

 MS_ROT3 - Elasticity matrix rotation.

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 Rotates an elasticity matrix around the three axes. 

 Usage: 
     [CR] = MS_rot3(C,alp,bet,gam)                    
         C: input 6x6 elasticity matrix 
         alp: clockwise rotation about 1-axis, looking at origin
         bet: clockwise rotation about 2-axis, looking at origin
         gam: clockwise rotation about 3-axis, looking at origin

     [CR] = MS_rot3(...,'order',V)                    
         order: V is a 3 element vector containing the order in which to apply the 3 rotations.
                Default is [1 2 3].

 Notes:
     Angles are given in degrees and correspond to yaw, -dip and aximuth,
     respectvly. The rotations are applied in order, ie: alpha, then beta
     then gamma (by default). The variables C, alp, bet and gam can be 
     arrays or scalars but (1) the angles must all be the
     same length and (2) either C or all the angles must be scalars unless
     they are the same length.
