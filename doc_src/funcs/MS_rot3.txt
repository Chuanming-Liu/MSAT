== MS_rot3

 Script to rotate a set of elastic constants (Cij) by 3 angles:

 alp = clockwise about 1-axis (looking at origin, == yaw)
 bet = clockwise about 2-axis (looking at origin, == -dip)
 gam = clockwise about 3-axis (looking at origin, == azimuth)

 [CR] = CIJ_rot3(C,alp,bet,gam)

  Inputs: the Cij elastic stiffness tensor, 3 angles (degrees)

  Output is the rotated Cij elastic stiffness tensor                  

  NOTE: The rotations are applied in order, ie: alpha, then beta then gamma
