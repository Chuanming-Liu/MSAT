== MS_elasticDB

 MS_ELASTICDB - Database of various elastic constants..

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 Given a reference string, uid, output the elastic stiffness matrix (in 
 GPa), density (in kg/m3) and a descriptive string. 

  [ ... ] = MS_elasticDB( uid )

 Usage: 
     [ C ] = MS_elasticDB( uid )                    
          Output the elasticity matrix corresponding to the reference 
          string uid (e.g. 'olivine'). C is a 6x6 matrix and is in GPa. 

     [ C, rh ] = MS_elasticDB( uid )                   
          Also return the density in kg/m3.

     [ C, rh, info ] = MS_elasticDB( uid )                    
          Also return a descriptive string describing the material and 
          source.
