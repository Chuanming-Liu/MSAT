== MS_rotR

 MS_ROTR - Script to rotate a set of elastic constants by a rotation matrix

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 Rotate an elasticity matrices using a rotation matrix

 [ CR ] = MS_rotEuler( C, R )

 Usage: 
     For a three-by-three rotation matrix, R, rotate the elasticity matrix,
     C to give a rotated matrix CR. 

 Notes:
    The rotation is performed without transforming the elasticity 
    matrix to the full tensor form following the method described in
    Bowers. This eleminates eight nested loops and replaces them with pure
    matrix-matrix operations, which is (~30 times) faster in Matlab. 
    Unlike the other MSAT rotation functions, C and R cannot be lists but
    must be 6x6 and 3x3 matricies, respectivly. Furthermore, the
    corectness of the input arguments are not checked. Users are encoraged
    to make use of MS_rot3 or MS_rotEuler for most rotation operations -
    these make use of this function internally.
