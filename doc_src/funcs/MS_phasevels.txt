== MS_phasevels

 CIJ_phasevels - calculate the phase velocity details for a set of elastic 
                 constants

 [pol,avs,vs1,vs2,vp] = CIJ_phasevels(C,rh,inc,azi)

	Inputs:
		inc and azi may be scalars, or vectors of the same size.

     AZI = angle from +ve 1-axis in x1-x2 plane                              
           (deg, +ve c'wise looking at origin from 3-axis)                  
     INC = angle from x1-x2 plane towards x3                                 
           (deg, zero is in x1-x2 plane)                                     

  Outputs: 

     'vp'  = P-wave velocity
     'vs1' = fast shear-wave velocity
     'vs2' = slow shear-wave velocity
     'avs' = shear-wave anisotropy
     'pol' = angle in plane normal to raypath of FSW                           
            (deg, zero is x3 direction, +ve c'wise looking along             
            raypath at origin)
