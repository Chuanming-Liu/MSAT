 MS_CIJ2CIJKL - Convert from Voigt elasticity matrix to tensor

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 Converts between a a 6x6 Voigt representation and a 3x3x3x3 tensor 
     representation of anisotropic elasticity. 

 [CC] = MS_cij2cijkl(C)

 Usage: 
     C must be a rank 2 array with size (6,6). The returned array C will 
     be rank 4 with size (3,3,3,3). 

 Notes:
     Do not use this function for the elastic compliance as additional
     terms are needed in this case.
