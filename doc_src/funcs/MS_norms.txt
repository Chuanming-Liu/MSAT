== MS_norms

 MS_NORMS - Browaeys and Chevrot analysis of the elasticity matrix.

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

  Calculate the percentages of the original matrix norm represented by the
  individual decompositions of an elasticity tensor C, after: 
     Browaeys and Chevrot (GJI, v159, 667-678, 2004)
  
  [P] = MS_norms(C,Ciso)
     Isotropic part (scalar)

  [P] = MS_norms(C,Ciso,Chex)
     Isotropic, and hexagonal parts of the elastic tensor (vector)

  [P] = MS_norms(C,Ciso,Chex,Ctet,Cort,Cmon,Ctri)
     All parts of the elastic tensor (vector)
     

 Notes:
     Input components of of C must first be calculated using MS_decomp.
     The output vector P will have as may elements as the number of
     decomposed parts of the input matrix that are provided.
