== MS_rotM

 MS_ROTM - CREATE A CARTESIAN ROTATION MATRIX

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 [ M ] = MS_rotM( alp, bet, gam )

  Inputs:
     alp - clockwise about 1-axis (looking at origin, == yaw)
     bet - clockwise about 2-axis (looking at origin, == -dip)
     gam - clockwise about 3-axis (looking at origin, == azimuth)
           angles are in ** degrees **, they should be scalars. 

  Output: is M, a 3x3 rotation matrix

     [M] = MS_rotM(...,'order',V)                    
         order: V is a 3 element vector containing the order in which to apply the 3 rotations.
                Default is [1 2 3].

  Notes: 
    The rotations are applied in order, ie: alpha, then beta then gamma (by default).
