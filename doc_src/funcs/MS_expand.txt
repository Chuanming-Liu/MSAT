== MS_expand

 MS_EXPAND - fill out elasticity matrix.

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 Expand a minimal set of elastic constants based on a specifed
             symmetry to a full Cij tensor. 

 [ Cf ] = MS_expand( C, mode )

 Usage: 
     Fill out elastic tensor C based on symmetry, defined by mode. This 
     can take the following values:
        'auto' - assume symmetry based on number of Cijs specified 
        'iso' - isotropic (nec=2) ; C33 and C66 must be specified.
        'hex' - hexagonal (nec=5) ; C33, C44, C11, C66 and C13 must be
                specified, x3 is symmetry axis
        'vti' - synonym for hexagonal
        'cubic' - cubic (nec=3) ; C33, C66 and C12 must be specified

     Cijs *not* specified in the appropriate symmetry should be zero in 
     the input matrix.
