== MS_Vrot3

 Script to rotate a ROW 3-vector by 3 angles:

 alp = clockwise about 1-axis (looking at origin, == yaw)
 bet = clockwise about 2-axis (looking at origin, == -dip)
 gam = clockwise about 3-axis (looking at origin, == azimuth)

 [VR] = CIJ_rot3(V,alp,bet,gam)

  Inputs: the vector, 3 angles (degrees)

  Output is the rotated vector                 

  NOTE: The rotations are applied in order, ie: alpha, then beta then gamma
