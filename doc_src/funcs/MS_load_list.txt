== MS_load_list

 MS_LOAD_LIST - Load a list of CIJs, in a specific format

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

 [x,C,rho] = MS_load_list(fname)

 Usage:
    As above, x is the independent variable (the first column in the file, 
    of length n) C is an array 6*6*n where n is the number of tensors 
    loaded rho is a vector of length n, the last column in the file
    currently, only 21 constant elastic files can be loaded. Lines in 
    the file should be of the form:
        x, c11,c12,...,c16,c22,...,c26,c33,...,c66,rho
