== MS_decomp

 MS_DECOMP - Browaeys and Chevrot decomposition of the elasticity matrix.

 // Part of MSAT - The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit //

  Apply a decomposition of the elasticity tensor C, after: 
     Browaeys and Chevrot (GJI, v159, 667-678, 2004)
  
  [Ciso] = MS_decomp(C)
     Isotropic projection of the elastic tensor.

  [Ciso,Chex] = MS_decomp(C)
     Isotropic, and hexagonal parts of the elastic tensor

  [Ciso,Chex,Ctet,Cort,Cmon,Ctri] = MS_decomp(C)
     All parts of the elastic tensor
     

 Notes:
     Output matricies are the partial components of the input elasticity
     matrix which maximise the norm of the high symmetry parts. This 
     function assumes that C is in its optimal orientation for 
     decomposition (use MS_axes to make this so).
