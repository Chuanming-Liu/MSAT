Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit - user guide
==============================================

The Matlab Seismic Anisotropy Toolkit (MSAT) is designed to 
facilitate the analysis and modelling of observations of seismic
and elastic anisotropy. This user guide provides information on
the range of link:MSATfunctions.html[functions] provided by the 
toolkit, some brief comments on the MSATbackground.html[background
theory] needed and link:MSATexamples.html[exmples] of how MSAT can be
used. Alongside the user guide is a shorter document describing 
how to link:MSATstart.html[get started] with MSAT and a full list 
of link:funcs/index.html[list of functions] with in-depth 
documentation for each one.
