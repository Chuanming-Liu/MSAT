MSAT Release Notes
==================

Version 0.8 - 4 October 2011
----------------------------

This is the first version of MSAT 
so there are no backwards incompatibility 
issues.  However, this is an alpha 
release and note that:

* Elastic constant interpolation for 
  trigonal symmetry does not work correctly.
* Several examples are incomplete. 
* Many of the functions are derived from 
  older "CIJ_" code. Argument orders and 
  details of what must be passed have been 
  freely changed. Do read the documentation.
