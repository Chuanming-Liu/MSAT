MSAT Release Notes
==================

Version 0.9 - 24 November 2011
------------------------------

This is the public beta version of 
MSAT with expanded documentation, 
new examples, some bug fixes and 
a few new functions. Users of version
0.8 are advised to upgrade. All users 
are encouraged to report bugs and 
request missing features. Major changes
from version 0.8 are:

* The way MS_plot handles optional 
arguments has been made consistent 
with the rest of the code. New 
optional arguments have been added. 

* An MSAT quick start guide has been 
added to the built-in and web based 
documentation. The full user guide 
has been started but is incomplete. 

* Six usage examples have been provided. 
They are located in subdirectories of 
the distributed examples directory.

* A new function, MS_poisson, has been 
added to evaluate Poisson's ratio for 
generally anisotropic materials as a 
function of strain direction.

* A new function, MS_VTI2, has been added 
to generate an elasticity matrix with 
hexagonal symmetry from the vp, vs, xi, 
phi and eta parameters sometimes used 
in global tomography.

* Provide a work around for Matlab version 
dependent compatibility issue in MS_checkC.

Version 0.8 - 4 October 2011
----------------------------

This is the first version of MSAT 
so there are no backwards incompatibility 
issues.  However, this is an alpha 
release and note that:

* Elastic constant interpolation for 
  trigonal symmetry does not work correctly.
* Several examples are incomplete. 
* Many of the functions are derived from 
  older "CIJ_" code. Argument orders and 
  details of what must be passed have been 
  freely changed. Do read the documentation.
